# AI-Powered Furniture Recommendation App (Ikarus)

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application that uses a combination of Machine Learning, NLP, and Generative AI to recommend furniture products and generate creative descriptions. The project was built over a 2-day span as part of an intern assignment.

The application features two main pages:
1.  **Recommendation Page:** A conversational UI where users can describe the furniture they're looking for and receive AI-powered recommendations.
2.  **Analytics Page:** A dashboard displaying visualizations and insights from the product dataset.
